<p>U.S. Army General Leslie Groves recruits Oppenheimer to lead the Manhattan Project to develop an atomic bomb after Oppenheimer assures Groves that he has no communist sympathies. Oppenheimer, who is Jewish, is particularly driven by the possibility that the Nazis have a nuclear weapons program underway, headed by Heisenberg.Oppenheimer assembles a scientific team in Los Alamos, New Mexico, to secretly create the bomb, intending it will save the world despite its potential global repercussions. During the development, Bohr visits and Oppenheimer discusses with Albert Einstein the possibility of such a bomb triggering a chain reaction that could destroy the world.

Eventually, the bomb is completed and the Trinity test is successfully conducted just before the Potsdam Conference. U.S. president Harry S. Truman decides to drop atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan's surrender and thrusting Oppenheimer into the public eye as the "father of the atomic bomb". Haunted by the immense destruction and suffering the bombs caused, Oppenheimer meets with Truman to urge restraint in developing even more powerful weapons. Truman perceives Oppenheimer's distress as weakness, and insists that as president, he alone bears responsibility for the bomb's use. Oppenheimer continues to feel intense guilt.</p>
