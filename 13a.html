<h3>The Tortoise and the Hare</h3>

This is an extremely popular story about a hare and a tortoise.
The hare is an animal that is known to move quickly, while a tortoise is one to move slowly.

Meanwhile the tortoise, who was extremely determined and dedicated to the race was slowly nearing the finish line.
The tortoise won the race while the hare napped. Most importantly he did it with humility and without arrogance.
